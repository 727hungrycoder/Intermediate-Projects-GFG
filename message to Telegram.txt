Have you ever wondered how people do automation on Telegram? You may know that Telegram has a big user base and so it is one of the preferred social media to read people. What good thing about Telegram is that it provides a bunch of API’s methods, unlike Whatsapp which restricts such things. So in this post, we will be sharing how to send messages to a Telegram user using Python.

Getting Started
First, create a bot using Telegram BotFather. To create a BotFather follow the below steps as follows:  

Open the telegram app and search for @BotFather.
Click on the start button or send “/start”.
Then send “/newbot” message to set up a name and a username.
After setting name and username BotFather will give you an API token which is your bot token.\
Then create an app on the telegram. Follow the below steps: 

Log into the telegram core: https://my.telegram.org
Go to ‘API development tools’ and fill out the form.
You will get the api_id and api_hash parameters required for user authorization. 

telebot: To install this module type the below command in the terminal.
pip install telebot
telethon: To install this module type the below command in the terminal. 
pip install telethon
Below is the implementation. 

# importing all required libraries
import telebot
from telethon.sync import TelegramClient
from telethon.tl.types import InputPeerUser, InputPeerChannel
from telethon import TelegramClient, sync, events
 
  
# get your api_id, api_hash, token
# from telegram as described above
api_id = 'API_id'
api_hash = 'API_hash'
token = 'bot token'
message = "Working..."
 
# your phone number
phone = 'YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER_WTH_COUNTRY_CODE'
  
# creating a telegram session and assigning
# it to a variable client
client = TelegramClient('session', api_id, api_hash)
  
# connecting and building the session
client.connect()
 
# in case of script ran first time it will
# ask either to input token or otp sent to
# number or sent or your telegram id 
if not client.is_user_authorized():
  
    client.send_code_request(phone)
     
    # signing in the client
    client.sign_in(phone, input('Enter the code: '))
  
  
try:
    # receiver user_id and access_hash, use
    # my user_id and access_hash for reference
    receiver = InputPeerUser('user_id', 'user_hash')
 
    # sending message using telegram client
    client.send_message(receiver, message, parse_mode='html')
except Exception as e:
     
    # there may be many error coming in while like peer
    # error, wrong access_hash, flood_error, etc
    print(e);
 
# disconnecting the telegram session 
client.disconnect()
Code Explanation: 

The code starts by importing all the required libraries.
The first library is telebot which is used to interact with Telegram.
Next, we import the sync module which helps us to keep our code organized and easy to read.
We also import the events module so that we can handle various telegram related events.
Next, we get our API_id, API_hash, and token from Telegram as described earlier in this tutorial.
Then, we create a variable called message for holding our message.
We then connect to Telegram and assign the session to a variable called client .
Next, we sign in the client using its phone number and user ID ( input(‘Enter the code: ‘)) .
Finally, we try sending a message using the telegram client but there may be many errors coming in while trying so let’s print them out for further analysis.
Once everything is okay, we disconnect the session by calling client.disconnect() .
The code will first import all the required libraries and set up a TelegramClient instance.
Next, it will get your API_id, API_hash and token from Telegram.
Finally, it will create a message variable and assign it to the client object.

Modules needed
You need several Python library imports for the script functioning.  


telebot: To install this module type the below command in the terminal.
pip install telebot
telethon: To install this module type the below command in the terminal. 
pip install telethon
Below is the implementation. 

his code is a Python script that uses the Telethon library to send a message to a specified user on Telegram using the Telegram API. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

Importing Libraries:

telebot: This library is commonly used for creating Telegram bots.
TelegramClient from telethon.sync: It is used for connecting to the Telegram API and performing various operations.
InputPeerUser, InputPeerChannel: Types used to represent users and channels.
sync, events: Modules from telethon for synchronous execution and handling events.
API Credentials and Token:

api_id: Your Telegram API ID obtained from the Telegram API development tools.
api_hash: Your Telegram API hash obtained from the Telegram API development tools.
token: The API token obtained from the BotFather when creating a Telegram bot.
Phone Number and Session:

phone: Your phone number with the country code.
client: Creating a TelegramClient instance with the specified session name, API credentials (api_id and api_hash).
Connecting to Telegram:

client.connect(): Establishing a connection to the Telegram server.
Authorization:

If the user is not already authorized, the script will send a code request to the specified phone number and prompt the user to enter the received code. This is done through the lines:
python
Copy code
if not client.is_user_authorized():
    client.send_code_request(phone)
    client.sign_in(phone, input('Enter the code: '))
Sending a Message:

The script tries to send a message to a specified user. You need to replace the placeholder values with actual values:
python
Copy code
receiver = InputPeerUser('user_id', 'user_hash')
client.send_message(receiver, message, parse_mode='html')
Replace 'user_id' and 'user_hash' with the actual user's ID and hash to whom you want to send the message.
message variable contains the text of the message.
parse_mode='html' is used to specify that the message is in HTML format.
Handling Exceptions:

The script includes a generic exception handler to print any exceptions that might occur during the execution.
Disconnecting from Telegram:

client.disconnect(): Disconnecting the Telegram session.
Remember to replace placeholder values with actual values for user_id, user_hash, and any other necessary details. Additionally, you should handle exceptions more gracefully in a production environment.

User
where can i find user_id and user_hash?
ChatGPT
The user_id and user_hash are specific identifiers associated with a Telegram user. You can obtain these values through the Telegram API or by using the Telethon library itself. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to find the user_id and user_hash:

Using Telethon:

a. You can use Telethon to retrieve the user_id and access_hash by running the following code snippet:

python
Copy code
from telethon.sync import TelegramClient

api_id = 'Your_API_ID'
api_hash = 'Your_API_HASH'
phone_number = 'User_Phone_Number_With_Country_Code'

with TelegramClient('session_name', api_id, api_hash) as client:
    user = client.get_me()
    print(f'user_id: {user.id}, access_hash: {user.access_hash}')
Replace 'Your_API_ID', 'Your_API_HASH', and 'User_Phone_Number_With_Country_Code' with your actual API credentials and the phone number of the user whose ID you want to obtain. The script will print the user_id and access_hash of the authenticated user.

Manually Obtaining User ID:

a. You can ask the user to send a message to your bot.

b. Retrieve the user_id by checking the updates received by your bot. The user_id will be present in the update.message.from_id field.

Note: The user_id is different from the chat_id. The chat_id is easier to obtain and can be used for sending messages, but it may not be suitable for all purposes.

Always ensure that you have the necessary permissions to obtain user information, and respect user privacy and terms of service when working with such data.

If you don't have a 'user_hash', just enter 0.

I.e.:

userid=555555555
userhash=0

receiver=InputPeerUser(userid, userhash)
For those requests having a “limit” parameter, you can often set it to zero to signify “return default amount”. This won’t work for all of them though, for instance, in “messages.search” it will actually return 0 items.
