"""he line import time is a Python statement that imports the time module into your Python script or program. The time module provides various time-related functions that allow you to work with time, such as measuring elapsed time, introducing delays, and formatting time values.

Here's a brief overview of what the time module typically offers:

Time Access Functions:

time.time(): Returns the current time in seconds since the epoch (the epoch is a predefined point in time, usually the beginning of the year 1970).
Sleep Function:

time.sleep(seconds): Suspends the execution of the program for the specified number of seconds. It is often used to introduce delays or pause the program.
Time Formatting:

time.localtime(): Returns the current local time as a time struct.
time.strftime(format, time_struct): Converts a time struct to a string according to a given format.
Here's a simple example using time.sleep():

python
Copy code
import time

print("Starting...")
time.sleep(2)  # Pauses the program for 2 seconds
print("After the pause.")
In this example, the program will print "Starting...", then pause for 2 seconds using time.sleep(2), and finally print "After the pause."

The time module is versatile and can be used in various scenarios where you need to work with time-related operations in your Python programs.
